This repository provides a comprehensive overview of Supervised Machine Learning and implements various models based on multiple datasets. Additionally, the models have been deployed on Streamlit. 

## Streamlit Deployment

You can access the deployed models using the following link:

## Notebooks/Model Reference

Any reference to as how the model was built with the parameters and tuning can be viewed in the [`notebooks`](https://github.com/aadi1011/Supervised-Machine-Learning-Modelling/tree/main/notebooks) folder. I wanted to make project completely open source and free as a good education platform for everyone to get a hands-on demo on how supervised machine learning models are created and easily deployed with streamlit
